1. Look at the imports, first of all
	a. express: cos duh, we just need it, it makes life easier
	b. bodyParser:to understand what the front end, is sending to us, we need to parse into our needs, here JSON was the need
	c. bcrypt: this is a library, that helps in hashing strings, and also comparing the hashes and other strings for match, very secure
	d. cors: i actually forgot, what this did??
	e. knex: the magic library, for making life simple when it comes to connecting to the database etc

2. Just a heads up, when every you want to talk about an object, enclose it with {}

3. set up server:
	1. mkdir project_folder
	2. cd project_folder
	3. npm init -y 
		you should see the package.json file being created in this step
	4. npm install (dependency-name) --save 
		you should see the dependencies updating your package.json file once they are installed
	5. start working

4. set up postgres db;
	1. sudo -i -u postgres
		you should be in root now
	2. psql
		you should ne within postgres sql now
	options:
		a. /l 
			displays all databases avaliable
		b. /c database_name 
			connects to the database
